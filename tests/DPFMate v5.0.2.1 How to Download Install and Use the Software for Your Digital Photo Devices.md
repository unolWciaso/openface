IntervalZero RTX 2011 is a software solution that transforms Windows into a real-time operating system (RTOS). It enables Windows applications to run with hard real-time performance and determinism, without requiring any modifications to the Windows operating system or hardware. IntervalZero RTX 2011 is ideal for applications that require high-performance, low-latency, and predictable response times, such as industrial automation, robotics, medical devices, aerospace, and defense.

IntervalZero RTX 2011 consists of two components: RTX Runtime and RTX Development. RTX Runtime is a kernel-level extension that runs alongside Windows and provides a separate real-time subsystem with its own scheduler, memory manager, interrupt handler, and device drivers. RTX Runtime allows users to create and run real-time processes that can access both Windows and RTX resources. RTX Development is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to create, debug, and deploy real-time applications using Visual Studio or Eclipse.
 
Some of the key features and benefits of IntervalZero RTX 2011 are:
 
- It supports Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Embedded Standard 7, and Windows XP.
- It supports x86 and x64 architectures, as well as multicore and multiprocessor systems.
- It supports symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) modes, allowing users to configure how Windows and RTX share the available CPU cores.
- It supports a variety of communication methods between Windows and RTX processes, such as shared memory, message queues, events, semaphores, pipes, sockets, and TCP/IP.
- It supports a range of real-time protocols and standards, such as EtherCAT, CANopen, Modbus TCP/IP, IEEE 1588 PTP, and OPC UA.
- It provides a rich set of APIs for developing real-time applications in C/C++, .NET, or Java.
- It integrates with popular third-party tools and frameworks, such as MATLAB/Simulink, LabVIEW, Qt, ROS, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
- It offers a flexible licensing model that allows users to pay only for the features they need.

One of the main advantages of IntervalZero RTX 2011 is that it allows users to leverage the existing Windows ecosystem and infrastructure, while adding real-time capabilities to their applications. Users can benefit from the familiar Windows user interface, the wide range of Windows applications and services, the extensive Windows hardware and software support, and the robust Windows security and reliability features. Users can also take advantage of the powerful Windows development tools and frameworks, such as Visual Studio, .NET, WPF, and WCF, to create rich and interactive user interfaces and complex business logic for their real-time applications.
 
Another benefit of IntervalZero RTX 2011 is that it enables users to reduce the hardware and software costs and complexity associated with traditional real-time solutions. Users can eliminate the need for separate real-time hardware platforms, such as dedicated controllers, PLCs, or DSPs, and consolidate their real-time and non-real-time functionality on a single Windows PC. Users can also simplify their software development and maintenance processes, by using a single integrated development environment (IDE) and a single programming language for both Windows and RTX applications. Users can also reuse their existing Windows code and libraries for their real-time applications, without requiring any modifications or recompilation.
