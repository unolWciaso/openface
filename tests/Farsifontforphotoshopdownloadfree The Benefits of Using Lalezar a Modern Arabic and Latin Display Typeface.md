## Step 1: Find a Farsi Font Website
 
The first step is to find a website that offers free Farsi fonts for download. There are many websites that provide this service, but some of them may not be reliable or safe. To avoid any malware or viruses, we recommend using one of these trusted websites:
 
- [FontSpace](https://www.fontspace.com/category/farsi): This website has a large collection of Farsi fonts in various styles and categories. You can browse by popularity, alphabetically, or by tags. You can also preview the fonts before downloading them.
- [FarsiFonts](https://www.farsifonts.com/): This website is dedicated to Farsi fonts and has over 500 fonts to choose from. You can search by name, style, or category. You can also see the ratings and reviews of each font by other users.
- [FontSquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/language/farsi): This website is known for its high-quality and free fonts for commercial use. It has a section for Farsi fonts that includes both modern and traditional styles. You can filter by license type, classification, or tag.

## Step 2: Download the Farsi Font File
 
Once you have found a Farsi font that you like, you need to download it to your computer. The font file will usually be in a ZIP or RAR format, which means you have to extract it first. To do this, you need a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download them for free from their official websites:

- [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html)
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

After you have installed the software, right-click on the font file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to (folder name)". This will create a new folder with the font file inside.
 
## Step 3: Install the Farsi Font on Your Computer
 
The final step is to install the Farsi font on your computer so that Photoshop can recognize it. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder where you extracted the font file.
2. Right-click on the font file and select "Install". Alternatively, you can copy and paste the font file into the Fonts folder in your Windows directory (C:\Windows\Fonts).
3. Restart Photoshop if it is already open.
4. Open a new or existing document in Photoshop and select the Text tool.
5. Click on the Font menu and scroll down until you find the Farsi font that you installed. Select it and start typing in Farsi.
