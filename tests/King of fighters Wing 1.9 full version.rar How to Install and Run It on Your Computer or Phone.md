- Learn the basic controls and commands. You can move with the WASD keys, jump with W, crouch with S, and dash with L. You can attack with UIOJKL keys, which correspond to light punch, light kick, heavy punch, heavy kick, special attack, and super attack. You can also perform different attacks by combining these keys with directional inputs.
- Choose a character that suits your playstyle. There are 32 characters to choose from in King of Fighters Wing 1.9, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some characters are fast and agile, some are strong and powerful, some are balanced and versatile, and some have unique abilities and gimmicks.

- Learn the combos and special moves of your character. Each character has a set of combos and special moves that can deal a lot of damage and stun the opponent. You can find the list of these moves in the pause menu or on these websites[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. You can also watch this video to see some examples of super combos performed by different characters.
- Use your power gauge wisely. Your power gauge is located at the bottom of the screen and fills up as you attack or get hit. You can use it to perform super attacks or cancel normal attacks into special attacks. Super attacks are very powerful but consume one or more bars of power gauge, depending on the character. Cancelling normal attacks into special attacks can extend your combos and surprise your opponent, but it also consumes some power gauge.
- Watch your health and stun meters. Your health meter is located at the top of the screen and shows how much damage you have taken. If it reaches zero, you lose the round. Your stun meter is located below your health meter and shows how close you are to getting stunned. If it fills up completely, you will be stunned for a few seconds and vulnerable to attacks. You can reduce your stun meter by pressing UIOJKL keys rapidly.

With these tips and tricks, you should be able to enjoy King of Fighters Wing 1.9 more and become a better fighter. Remember to have fun and challenge yourself with different game modes and difficulty levels.
