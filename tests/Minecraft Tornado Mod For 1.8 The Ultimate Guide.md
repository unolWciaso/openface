One of the most popular and fun mods is the Tornado Mod. This mod adds tornadoes to the game, which can destroy anything in their path. You can also create your own tornadoes using a special item called the Tornado Gun. The mod also adds new items, blocks, and mobs related to weather and disasters.
 
If you want to try out this mod, you will need to install it first. Here are the steps to install the Tornado Mod for Minecraft 1.8:
 
1. Download the mod file from [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tornado-mod).
2. Download and install Minecraft Forge for 1.8 from [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.html).
3. Open the Minecraft launcher and select Forge as your profile.
4. Run the game once to create the mods folder.
5. Copy the mod file you downloaded into the mods folder.
6. Restart the game and enjoy the mod.

To use the mod, you will need to craft or find the Tornado Gun. This item lets you spawn tornadoes by right-clicking on the ground. You can also adjust the size and strength of the tornadoes using the GUI that opens when you right-click with the gun in your hand.
 
Be careful though, as tornadoes can be very destructive and dangerous. They can pick up blocks, items, animals, and even players and throw them around. They can also damage structures and terrain. You can protect yourself from tornadoes by wearing a special helmet called the Storm Chaser Helmet, which reduces the damage you take from flying objects.
 
The mod also adds other features such as wind, clouds, rain, hail, lightning, sirens, sensors, debris, and more. You can customize the mod settings using the config file or the in-game menu. You can also disable or enable certain features using commands.
