If you have an Epson PX660 printer that is showing errors such as "Service required" or "Ink pad is at the end of its service life", you may need to reset it using an adjustment program. An adjustment program is a software tool that can reset the waste ink counter and other settings of your printer. In this article, we will show you how to download and use the adjustment program for Epson PX660 printer.
  
## What is an adjustment program?
  
An adjustment program is a software tool that can reset the waste ink counter and other settings of your printer. The waste ink counter is a part of the printer that keeps track of how much ink is used for cleaning the print head and other maintenance tasks. When the waste ink counter reaches a certain limit, the printer will stop working and display an error message. This is to prevent the waste ink from overflowing and damaging the printer or the environment.

An adjustment program can reset the waste ink counter and clear the error message, allowing you to use your printer again. However, this does not mean that the waste ink is gone. You still need to replace or clean the waste ink pad or install an external waste ink tank to avoid ink leakage. An adjustment program can also reset other settings of your printer, such as page count, EEPROM data, head ID, etc.
