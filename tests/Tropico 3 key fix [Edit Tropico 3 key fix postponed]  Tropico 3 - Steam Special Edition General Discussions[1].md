Tropico 3 is a strategy game that lets you play as a dictator of a Caribbean island during the Cold War.

But what if you want to play the game without entering a serial number every time you launch it?

Some players have reported that Tropico 3 asks for a serial number every time they start the game, even if they have already activated it on Steam. This can be annoying and frustrating, especially if you lose or forget your serial number. Fortunately, there is a way to fix this issue and play Tropico 3 without serial number.
 
The solution is to block the game from accessing the internet using your firewall. This will prevent the game from checking your serial number online and allow you to play offline. Here are the steps to do this:
 
1. Find the location of your Tropico 3 executable file. It should be something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tropico 3\Tropico3.exe
2. Open your firewall settings and create a new rule to block outbound connections for Tropico 3.
3. Apply the rule and restart your computer.
4. Launch Tropico 3 and enjoy the game without serial number.

Note that this method will disable online features such as multiplayer and achievements. If you want to use them, you will need to unblock the game from your firewall and enter your serial number again.
 
If you have any questions or problems with this method, you can visit the official Tropico 3 thread on Kaskus, a popular Indonesian forum. There you can find other players who share their tips, tricks, and experiences with Tropico 3. You can also download mods, patches, and updates for the game from there.
